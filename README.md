# CHOYA – The Drakthyr Invasion

![CHOYA Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/your_banner_placeholder.jpg)

**CHOYA** is an immersive, choice-driven, text-based Interactive Novel developed in Godot 4, built on the foundation of the [Interactive Story System](https://github.com/user/interactive-story-system). This narrative-rich experience combines branching storytelling, RPG stat systems, and environmental focus mechanics to bring you into the world of Lyaris Alaric Talbot, a man with no memory, surrounded by mystery, conflict, and fate.

### 📘 Introduction

The game begins with **Lyaris Alaric Talbot**, a man suffering from short-term memory loss, wandering a dense forest with no visible injuries—only exhaustion and a fading grasp on who he is. While trying to piece together his past, he's attacked by a wolf and saved at the last moment by a hunter named **Kaela**. Before he can thank her, he collapses.

When Lyaris awakens, he finds himself in new clothes, missing his dagger and map, and discovers he's been unconscious for three days. As Kaela guides him to a tavern to rest and talk, Lyaris grows suspicious—but Kaela reassures him with a sharp sense of humor. Their conversation is interrupted by a local villager reporting disturbances caused by wild boars, setting them on a new path together.

As Lyaris explores the world, he will uncover not only the threads of his past but also face life-altering choices: join a secretive death cult, rise as a noble knight, chase economic power, or live as a wandering hero. Every choice matters, and every path has consequences.

## ✨ Inspiration

This project was created by **Glenville Dixon Jr** in honor of one of his favorite mobile RPGs—**Magium**.

> *“Magium is a text adventure game where you play as an ordinary guy trying to win a mage tournament against the most powerful mages in the world... As you progress, you uncover the mystery of ancient utopias, speak the language of monsters, and fight to save a dying world.”*

Much like **Magium**, **CHOYA** combines character-driven storytelling with deep systems and world-building to deliver a personal and epic journey for each player.
